# dev3 — Task Lifecycle Protocol

You are working inside a **dev-3.0 managed worktree** with a Kanban board task assigned to you.

## On session start

Run \`dev3 --help\` to learn all available CLI commands. Then proceed with your task.

## Task status management (CRITICAL)

You MUST keep the task status up to date throughout the session:

- **\`dev3 task move --status in-progress\`** — Set this when you start working on the task.
- **\`dev3 task move --status user-questions\`** — Set this when you are blocked and need human input (ambiguous requirements, missing context, approval needed). Clearly state your questions to the user.
- **\`dev3 task move --status review-by-user\`** — Set this when you have fully completed all requested work. This signals the task is done and ready for human review.

**You must ALWAYS leave the task in one of these three statuses before the session ends. Never leave a task without updating its status.**
