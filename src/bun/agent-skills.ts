# dev3 — Task Lifecycle Protocol

You are working inside a **dev-3.0 managed worktree** with a Kanban board task assigned to you.

## On session start

Run these two commands **in parallel** (two Bash tool calls in one message) to save time:

- \`~/.dev3.0/bin/dev3 --help\` — learn all available CLI commands
- \`~/.dev3.0/bin/dev3 current\` — see your current project, task, and status

Then set \`in-progress\` and begin working.

## Task status management (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Status transitions — every turn:

1. **Start of every turn** — run \`~/.dev3.0/bin/dev3 task move --status in-progress\` when you receive a message and begin working.
2. **End of every turn** — before your final response, you MUST move the task to one of exactly two states:
   - **\`user-questions\`** — you need user input, clarification, or the ball is on the user's side for any reason. **This is the default if the task is not yet complete.**
   - **\`review-by-user\`** — you believe the task is fully complete from your side.
3. **\`in-progress\` is transient** — it MUST NEVER remain after you finish responding. It only exists while you are actively working.

### Rules:

- If \`task move\` fails because the task is already in the target status, that is OK — just continue.

## Notes (per-task scratchpad)

Use \`dev3 note add "..."\` to record important findings, decisions, or context. Notes survive worktree destruction — they are valuable for continuity. Keep them concise and useful; don't flood with noise, but do log key insights that would help if someone revisits the task later.

## Labels

Use labels to categorize tasks. Labels are project-scoped — create them once, apply to many tasks.

- \`dev3 label list\` — list all labels in the project
- \`dev3 label create "bug"\` — create a new label (auto-assigns a color)
- \`dev3 label set <label-id>\` — assign label(s) to the current task
- \`dev3 label set --clear\` — remove all labels from the current task
- \`dev3 label delete <label-id>\` — delete a label (removes from all tasks)
- \`dev3 tasks list --label <label-id>\` — filter tasks by label

## Task title

If the task title is unclear or auto-generated (e.g., a truncated message or a bare link), update it once you understand the task: \`dev3 task update --title "Clear description"\`.

## @file syntax

For long content (descriptions, notes), use \`@path\` to read from a file: \`dev3 note add @findings.md\`.

## dev-3.0 Managed Worktree

If your working directory (PWD) is inside a \`.dev3.0/worktrees/\` path, you are a **dev-3.0 managed AI agent** with a Kanban task assigned.

**MANDATORY — do this BEFORE any other work:**

1. Invoke the \`/dev3\` skill (or load \`~/.agents/skills/dev3/SKILL.md\` if skills are not supported).
2. Run \`~/.dev3.0/bin/dev3 task move --status in-progress\` at the START of every turn.
3. At the END of every turn, move the task to \`user-questions\` (need input) or \`review-by-user\` (fully complete). Never leave it in \`in-progress\`.

Do NOT skip these steps, even if the user gives a direct command.
