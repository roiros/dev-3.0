const SKILL_BODY = `# dev3 — Task Lifecycle Protocol

You are working inside a **dev-3.0 managed worktree** with a Kanban board task assigned to you.

## Branch naming

After learning your current task, check if the branch matches \`dev3/task-*\` (opaque auto-generated name).
If it does, **rename it immediately** to something meaningful based on the task description:

\`\`\`bash
git branch -m dev3/task-XXXXXXXX dev3/<slug>
\`\`\`

**Rules:**
- Always keep the \`dev3/\` prefix.
- Use lowercase kebab-case, 3-5 words: \`dev3/fix-auth-race-condition\`, \`dev3/add-drag-reorder\`.
- Derive the slug from the task description/title — be concise but descriptive.
- If the branch already has a meaningful name (does NOT match \`dev3/task-*\`), skip renaming.
- If the branch was already pushed, also update the remote: \`git push origin :<old> && git push -u origin <new>\`.

Run this ONCE at session start, right after setting \`in-progress\`.

## Title generation

The task title is auto-generated from the first 80 characters of the description.
After learning your current task, if the title looks truncated (ends with "…") or is
longer than ~6 words, synthesize a concise title and update it:

  dev3 task update --title "Short imperative phrase"

Good titles: "Fix auth race condition", "Map missing keyboard bindings", "Add drag-to-reorder support"
Bad titles: copies of the description, vague summaries, titles with ellipsis
Run this ONCE at session start, before doing any other work.

## Task status management (CRITICAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Status transitions — every turn:

1. **Start of every turn** — run \`~/.dev3.0/bin/dev3 task move --status in-progress\` when you receive a message and begin working.
2. **End of every turn** — before your final response, you MUST move the task to one of exactly two states:
   - **\`user-questions\`** — you need user input, clarification, or the ball is on the user's side for any reason. **This is the default if the task is not yet complete.** (shown in UI as "Waiting for You")
   - **\`review-by-user\`** — you believe the task is fully complete from your side.
3. **\`in-progress\` is transient** — it MUST NEVER remain after you finish responding. It only exists while you are actively working. (shown in UI as "Agent is Working")

### Rules:

- If \`task move\` fails because the task is already in the target status, that is OK — just continue.

### Custom columns

If the project defines custom columns (visible in \`dev3 current\` output), you can move tasks there:

  dev3 task move --status <custom-column-id>

Each custom column has an 8-char ID prefix and a description of when to use it.
Moving to a custom column does not affect the worktree or terminal session.
To move a task back to a built-in status, use the regular \`dev3 task move\` command.

## Notes (per-task scratchpad)

Use \`dev3 note add "..."\` to record important findings, decisions, or context. Notes survive worktree destruction — they are valuable for continuity. Keep them concise and useful; don't flood with noise, but do log key insights that would help if someone revisits the task later.

## dev-3.0 Managed Worktree

If your working directory (PWD) is inside \`~/.dev3.0/worktrees/\` (i.e. \`$HOME/.dev3.0/worktrees/\`), you are a **dev-3.0 managed AI agent** with a Kanban task assigned. Regular git worktrees or other paths containing "worktrees" do **NOT** qualify — only the dev-3.0 managed directory under the user's home.

**MANDATORY — do this BEFORE any other work:**

1. Invoke the \`/dev3\` skill (or load \`~/.agents/skills/dev3/SKILL.md\` if skills are not supported).
2. Run \`~/.dev3.0/bin/dev3 task move --status in-progress\` at the START of every turn.
3. At the END of every turn, move the task to \`user-questions\` (need input) or \`review-by-user\` (fully complete). Never leave it in \`in-progress\`.

Do NOT skip these steps, even if the user gives a direct command.
