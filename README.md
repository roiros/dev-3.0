## The problem

You're running 5+ AI agents across different terminals, repos, and branches. Switching context takes forever. You lose track of what's where. Merge conflicts pile up because multiple agents edit the same repo.

## The solution

dev-3.0 gives you a Kanban board where each task is a fully isolated environment:

1. **Create a task** on the board — describe what needs to be done
2. **An isolated git worktree** is created automatically — zero conflicts between parallel agents
3. **A terminal with tmux** launches inside the worktree with your configured command (e.g., `claude`)
4. **See everything at a glance** — hover over any card for a live terminal preview

</p>

## Key features

- **Kanban workflow** — drag tasks between columns (To Do → In Progress → Review → Completed)
- **Git worktree per task** — full repo isolation, no merge conflicts between parallel agents
- **Multi-agent launch** — run the same task with Claude, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, or any CLI agent — each with its own config
- **Live terminal preview** — hover any card to see what the agent is doing right now
- **Terminal bell alerts** — red badges on cards when an agent needs your attention
- **Labels & search** — organize tasks with colored labels and instant full-text search
- **Dark & light themes** — full theme support for both dark and light environments
- **Automated setup** — configure a setup script per project that runs for every new task
- **Copy-on-Write clone paths** — clone `node_modules`, `.venv`, `build`, and other heavy directories into worktrees instantly with near-zero disk overhead
- **PR review mode** — check out any remote branch and toggle "PR review" to pre-fill a structured code-review prompt for the agent

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```sh
brew tap h0x91b/dev3
brew install --cask dev3
```

This will also install required dependencies (`git`, `tmux`) if not already present.

```sh
# Update to latest version
brew upgrade --cask dev3

# Uninstall
brew uninstall --cask dev3
```

### Manual download

Download the latest `.dmg` from [**Releases**](https://github.com/h0x91b/dev-3.0/releases), drag to Applications, and run. Make sure `git` and `tmux` are installed.

macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel) and Linux — Windows coming soon.
